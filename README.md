# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project aims to analyze the survival rates of passengers aboard the Titanic, focusing on how passenger class and age impact survival outcomes. The analysis also investigates whether certain passenger categories are more vulnerable during the disaster, using SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power BI for data analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset provides key details about passengers, such as class, age, sex, and survival status. The goal of this project is to identify significant patterns and insights related to survival rates and explore how different factors such as passenger class and age categories affected survival chances.

## Objectives

- **Analyze Survival Rates by Passenger Class**: Investigate how the class of the passenger (first, second, or third) impacted survival chances.
- **Age and Vulnerability**: Assess how age categories (children, adults, seniors) influenced the survival rates within each passenger class.
- **Dashboard Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards using Tableau and Power BI to visualize the findings and make the data more accessible.

## Key Findings

- First-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates than third-class passengers.
- Children in second-class had a 100% survival rate, while children in third-class had a lower survival rate.
- Seniors in the first class had a low survival rate (only one survivor), while no seniors survived in second and third classes.
  
## Tools Used

- **SQL**: Data extraction and transformation from the Titanic dataset.
- **Python**: Data analysis, cleaning, and statistical analysis.
- **Tableau**: Visualization of the survival rate analysis across various passenger classes and age groups.
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard for real-time insights into the data.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: The raw dataset was cleaned and processed to ensure accuracy. Missing values were handled, and irrelevant columns were removed.
2. **SQL Queries**: Key SQL queries were executed to extract necessary data points, including survival rates by class and age.
3. **Python Analysis**: Python was used for deeper analysis, including calculating survival rates and performing statistical analysis on age and class categories.
4. **Visualization**: The insights were visualized using Tableau and Power BI for an interactive user experience.
5. **Dashboard Creation**: Power BI and Tableau dashboards were developed to present the findings in a user-friendly way.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download the dataset and run the SQL queries in your preferred SQL environment (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, or PostgreSQL).
2. Use the provided Tableau and Power BI links to view the dashboards.

## Future Improvements

- Perform a deeper statistical analysis to determine the significance of survival rates in different passenger categories.
- Investigate emergency accessibility measures that could have minimized the survival disparities between passenger classes.
- Conduct simulations or build predictive models to forecast survival probabilities based on passenger features.
